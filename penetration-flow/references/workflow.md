# Penetration Flow Workflow

## Phase 0 ? Intake and ROE

Capture:

- Objective: what decision the assessment must support.
- Scope: assets, CIDRs, domains, repos, apps, accounts, artifacts, environments.
- Authorization: owner, dates, allowed windows, forbidden actions, rate limits.
- Constraints: production sensitivity, test data, logging contacts, emergency stop.
- Deliverables: interim report, final report, reproduction package, executive summary.

If active testing is not yet approved, limit work to passive review, artifact analysis, threat modeling, documentation review, and report planning.

## Phase 1 ? Analysis

Produce an assessment map:

- Asset inventory and trust boundaries.
- Entry points and exposed interfaces.
- Authentication and authorization surfaces.
- Data flows and sensitive assets.
- Dependency and supply-chain exposure.
- Known vulnerability leads with source and confidence.
- Reverse-engineering candidates: binaries, APK/IPA, firmware, captures, macros, protocols, obfuscated scripts.

Output an evidence table and a hypothesis backlog.

## Phase 2 ? Report Snapshot

After every meaningful step, produce a compact snapshot:

- What changed since last snapshot.
- Evidence collected.
- Confirmed findings and severity.
- Unconfirmed leads.
- Risk to schedule/scope.
- Recommended next step.

## Phase 3 ? Deep Penetration

Pick one lane at a time:

- Web/API: authn/authz, session, input validation, business logic, SSRF, file handling, deserialization, CORS, GraphQL, rate limits.
- Network/internal: exposed services, segmentation, weak protocols, credential hygiene, AD/Kerberos review when in scope.
- Cloud/container: IAM, storage, metadata access, secrets, CI/CD, image provenance, Kubernetes RBAC/network policies.
- Code/dependency audit: dangerous sinks, unsafe deserialization, injection, path traversal, crypto misuse, secrets, third-party CVEs.
- Reverse engineering: follow `reverse-engineering.md`.
- Configuration review: default credentials, debug flags, missing hardening, unsafe headers, permissive policies.

Before executing a test, state: target, method, expected signal, risk, rollback/stop condition.

## Phase 4 ? Vulnerability Reporting

Promote a lead to a finding only when evidence supports:

- Affected asset/component/version.
- Preconditions and required privileges.
- Reproduction summary.
- Impact and business consequence.
- Severity rationale, preferably CVSS plus context.
- Remediation and verification steps.

## Phase 5 ? Controlled Exploitation Validation

Use the lowest-impact proof that demonstrates the security property:

- Read-only checks over destructive mutation.
- Synthetic markers over sensitive data.
- Local lab reproduction over production exploitation.
- One-shot proof over repeated exploitation.
- Screenshots/logs/hashes over bulk exfiltration.

Document exact bounds, inputs, outputs, timestamps, and cleanup.

## Phase 6 ? User Choice

Always stop at a decision boundary with the menu from SKILL.md. If the user chooses a phase, update state and proceed. If the user supplies new evidence, return to analysis.
