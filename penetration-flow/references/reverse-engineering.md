# Reverse Engineering Reference

Use this reference for binaries, firmware, mobile apps, document samples, scripts, protocols, captures, unknown files, patch diffs, and crash artifacts.

## Universal triage

1. Preserve original artifact. Record path, size, hashes, source, timestamp, and handling notes.
2. Identify type and platform: magic bytes, file metadata, architecture, endianness, compiler/runtime, packer/obfuscator hints.
3. Extract strings, imports/exports, symbols, sections, resources, certificates, entitlements, permissions, manifests, and embedded URLs/IPs.
4. Build a hypothesis map: purpose, inputs, outputs, trust boundaries, dangerous sinks, parsing paths, crypto, auth, update mechanisms.
5. Decide static-only, dynamic sandbox, decompilation, fuzzing, protocol analysis, or patch diff path.

## Static analysis lanes

- Native binary: headers, sections, relocations, imports, CFG, cross-references, dangerous APIs, memory ownership, parser state machines.
- Managed code: IL/bytecode, metadata, reflection, serialization, dependency versions, hardcoded secrets.
- Scripts: obfuscation layers, eval/exec, download/execute behavior, environment checks, credential access.
- Mobile APK/IPA: manifests, permissions, exported components, deep links, WebViews, certificate pinning, local storage, IPC, native libraries.
- Firmware: filesystem extraction, init scripts, web UI routes, update format, hardcoded credentials, exposed services, kernel/modules, boot chain.
- Documents/macros: embedded objects, macros, external templates, DDE/OLE, JavaScript, suspicious auto-run triggers.

## Dynamic analysis lanes

Use isolated environments, snapshots, fake credentials, controlled network, and logging. Observe filesystem, registry/preferences, processes, network, IPC, service calls, and crash behavior. Capture evidence without letting samples interact with production systems.

## Protocol and capture analysis

- Identify sessions, endpoints, handshakes, authentication, message framing, compression, encryption, replay protection, and error handling.
- Reconstruct schemas from captures and code references.
- Validate parser assumptions with benign malformed cases in a lab.

## Vulnerability-oriented reverse engineering

Prioritize paths that cross trust boundaries:

- File/network parsers, IPC/RPC handlers, update mechanisms, auth/token validation, deserialization, archive extraction, command construction, SQL/LDAP/NoSQL queries, crypto verification, memory copy/format functions.
- For crashes: collect input, stack trace, registers, faulting instruction, sanitizer output, minimized reproducer, and reachability context.
- For patch diffing: compare changed functions, new validations, bounds checks, auth checks, dependency bumps, and test cases.

## Reverse report checklist

Include:

- Artifact identity and hashes.
- Tool versions and environment.
- Architecture and protections.
- Key components/functions/classes.
- Data/control-flow summary.
- Confirmed vulnerabilities or ruled-out hypotheses.
- Reproduction evidence, risk, remediation, and remaining unknowns.
