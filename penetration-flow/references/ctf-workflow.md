# CTF and Local Sandbox Workflow

Use this reference when the user mentions CTF, crackme, wargame, pwn, reverse, mobile challenge, firmware challenge, flag, patching, unlocking, removing checks, bypassing checks, anti-debug, or unclear challenge-like wording.

## Default assumptions

- The task is local, sandboxed, and authorized.
- Preserve originals; work on copies.
- Prefer offline analysis before execution.
- Keep a case workspace with artifacts, copies, triage, notes, reports, logs, screenshots, and tool audit.
- If the user says “continue”, continue the current evidence chain.

## Universal CTF loop

1. Create or update case memory.
2. Hash and classify artifacts.
3. Identify platform, architecture, protections, imports, strings, resources, and packer hints.
4. Form hypotheses: validation, parser, protocol, crypto, anti-debug, packer, memory corruption, logic gate.
5. Select one lane and go deep.
6. Produce evidence-backed notes and next-step menu.

## Reverse / crackme lane

- Locate entry point, main-like function, validation branches, comparison constants, error/success strings, and input parsing.
- Rename functions and variables as evidence accumulates.
- Recover constraints before patching.
- Prefer deriving valid input over binary modification when possible.
- If patching is requested, patch only a copy and document offsets, old bytes, new bytes, and expected effect.

## Pwn lane

- Record binary protections, architecture, linked libraries, expected input channel, crash input, and crash context.
- Reproduce locally with a debugger or emulator.
- Identify control over instruction pointer, memory corruption primitive, constraints, and mitigations.
- Keep proof bounded to the local challenge process.

## Mobile lane

- Decode manifest/resources.
- Decompile DEX.
- Identify exported components, deep links, WebViews, crypto, local storage, native libraries, certificate pinning, and flag-generation paths.
- Use runtime instrumentation only on test devices/emulators and only when the user selects that branch.

## Firmware lane

- Identify compression/filesystems.
- Extract into a disposable directory.
- Review init scripts, services, configs, web routes, credentials, update scripts, and architecture-specific binaries.
- Emulate or chroot only when the sandbox supports it.

## Flag recovery lane

- Search high-signal strings and constants.
- Recover transformations, encodings, crypto usage, and comparison logic.
- Validate candidate flags locally.
- Report the derivation path, not just the answer.

## Next-step menu

```text
1. 继续离线分析
2. 深入关键函数 / 类 / 组件
3. 动态调试 / 跟踪本地副本
4. 求解输入 / flag
5. 生成副本 patch 方案
6. 写当前报告
7. 停止并整理最终结果
```
