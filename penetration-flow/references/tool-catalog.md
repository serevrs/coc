## Selection rules

- Start with `file/hash/strings` and one primary decompiler/disassembler.
- Use Ghidra for broad native analysis; radare2/Rizin for fast CLI and automation; x64dbg/pwndbg/GEF for dynamic traces.
- Use JADX + apktool + Frida/objection-style runtime inspection for Android CTF/lab tasks.
- Use binwalk + filesystem extraction + strings/config review for firmware.
- Use angr/pwntools/Unicorn/Qiling when the user asks for CTF solving, path constraints, emulation, or controlled proof in a local lab.
- Use capa/FLARE-VM/Volatility for suspicious samples or memory artifacts in an isolated VM.
